## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

Check if installed:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```


### 2. Project Setup

Create a new folder and set up a virtual environment:

```bash
mkdir ai_safety_backend
cd ai_safety_backend
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install Flask SQLAlchemy
```

---

### 4. Create Project Files

Create the following files:

- `app.py`
- `models.py`
- `requirements.txt`

`database.db` will be auto-created when the server runs.

To create empty files quickly:

```bash
touch app.py models.py requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Running the Server

Activate the virtual environment (if not already activated):

```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
